The latest version retains its original simple and easy-to-use features and powerful functions, all because &amp;#x2764;&amp;#xfe0f; Let&amp;rsquo;s start again. We hope you will also enjoy it and welcome you to join us smile:
Origin The earliest version of the NexT theme for Hugo should have been created by Lanlingzi Provided, the release date can be traced back to 2016. In the early stages, my personal blog theme also adopted his version and made relevant optimizations and improvements on this basis(which has also received a lot of attention from users after being open sourced). You can refer to the previous record sharing:
Process of Optimizing Hugo NexT Theme Process of Optimizing Hugo NexT Theme 2 Personally, I still prefer the style of the NexT theme. However, as I delved deeper into using it, I found that the theme is not user-friendly in terms of compatibility and display effects. I had planned to continue optimizing it, but the original framework was still based on an older Hugo version. In addition, I also browsed the latest version of the Hexo NexT theme, and the difference in display effects is still quite significant.
So the idea of refactoring and transplanting the Hexo NexT theme emerged. It happened to be during the outbreak of the Shanghai epidemic, and the suppressed emotions of working from home made me want to find something to do. Therefore, I started planning and preparing, and after organizing, I found that there were still many things to do, so I used a mind map to record them.
After more than two months of intermittent time, I finally completed the porting of all the main functions. In fact, I have always wanted someone to participate in the co construction. I once went directly to the Hexo NexT user group to &amp;ldquo;shout&amp;rdquo;, but it did not stir up any waves, so I had to continue to move forward independently for the time being joy:
Donation In the process of rebuilding the Hugo NexT theme, there were also some difficulties regarding the hosting of the theme code. After careful consideration, it was decided to donate it to the organization. This would make the subsequent team assistance smoother, as well as designing the corresponding logo and domain name, which would display it more professionally and formally.
Development Agreement This topic references the standard Git Branching Model The development process of the pattern refers to the following:
Main branch: mainly used to publish developed and stable functional code Develop branch: Develop and quickly release all new and testing features Adopting this development process model takes into account two factors:
On main branch: it facilitates the development or rapid iteration of uncertain functions and allows for online preview of real effects On develop branch: it can simplify user operations without being affected by unstable functions Info Note: When merging branch code locally, be sure to include the --no-ff parameter to ensure that the historical commit records are not &amp;ldquo;losted&amp;rdquo; .
Compatibility This theme can be displayed on both PC and mobile devices simultaneously. The following is a compatibility explanation for different browsers on PC.
Browser Supported Version Edge 79+ Firefox 52+ Chrome 49+ Safari 11+ Opera 37+ Future plans Most of the page design and feature porting for the Hugo NexT theme have been completed, and the remaining features will be gradually improved in subsequent versions and continuously iterated for release
Create quick deployment templates and scripts &amp;#x1f9d1;&amp;zwj;&amp;#x1f527;
Continuously improve the functionality of other details &amp;#x2728;
Optimize the performance of site generation efficiency &amp;#x26a1;
Write a user guide manual for the topic &amp;#x1f4dd;
Thank you for your attention, and you are also welcome to participate in the development or maintenance of the theme &amp;#x2764;&amp;#xfe0f;

Recently, it has been discovered that Hugo has been updated from v0.134.0 . From the beginning of the version, it is possible to support rendering Blockquote styles in Markdown documents through hook mode (which needs to be implemented by oneself), achieving warning style styles similar to Github. So 7 different styles were added to the Hugo NexT theme for users to choose from, and they could also customize icons and color configurations.
Users can find the positions of the following two configuration items and adjust them according to their preferred style and color:

$$ \displaystyle= \left(\sum_{i=1}^ {k}i \right) +(k+1) $$
$$ \displaystyle= \frac{k(k+1)}{2}+k+1 $$
$$ \displaystyle= \frac{k(k+1)+2(k+1)}{2} $$
$$ \displaystyle= \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2} $$
$$ \displaystyle= \frac{(k+1)((k+1)+1)}{2} $$
Riding symbols $$ \displaystyle 1 + \frac{q^2}{(1-q)}+\frac{q^6}{(1-q)(1-q^2)}+\cdots = $$
$$ \displaystyle \prod_{j=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(1-q^{5j+2})(1-q^{5j+3})}, \displaystyle\text{ for }\lvert q\rvert &amp;lt; 1. $$
Random number formula These are some linear mathematics:$ k_{n+1} = n^2 + k_n^2 - k_{n-1} $ ， Then there are more texts.
Greek alphabet $$ \displaylines{\Gamma\ \Delta\ \Theta\ \Lambda\ \Xi\ \Pi\ \Sigma\ \Upsilon\ \Phi\ \Psi\ \Omega \alpha\ \beta\ \gamma\ \delta\ \epsilon\ \zeta\ \\ \eta\ \theta\ \iota\ \kappa\ \lambda\ \mu\ \nu\ \xi \ \omicron\ \pi\ \rho\ \sigma\ \tau\ \upsilon\ \phi\ \chi\ \psi\ \omega\ \varepsilon\ \vartheta\ \varpi\ \varrho\ \varsigma\ \varphi} $$

Calculus $$ \int u \frac{dv}{dx},dx=uv-\int \frac{du} {dx}v , dx $$
$$ f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \hat f(\xi),e^{2 \pi i \xi x} $$
$$ \oint \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{s}=0 $$
Lorenz equation $$ \begin{aligned} \dot{x} &amp;amp; = \sigma(y-x) \\ \dot{y} &amp;amp; = \rho x - y - xz \\ \dot{z} &amp;amp; = -\beta z + xy \end{aligned} $$
Cross product This is feasible in KaTeX, but the separation of fractions is not very good in this environment.
$$ \mathbf {V}_1 \times \mathbf {V}_2 = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} &amp;amp; \mathbf{j} &amp;amp; \mathbf{k} \\ \frac{\partial X}{\partial u} &amp;amp; \frac{\partial Y}{\partial u} &amp;amp; 0 \\ \frac{\partial X}{\partial v} &amp;amp; \frac{\partial Y}{\partial v} &amp;amp; 0 \end{vmatrix} $$
Here is a solution: use additional classes of the &amp;ldquo;mfrac&amp;rdquo; class (no difference in the case of MathJax) to make the score smaller:
$$ \mathbf {V}_1 \times \mathbf {V}_2 = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} &amp;amp; \mathbf{j} &amp;amp; \mathbf{k} \\ \frac{\partial X}{\partial u} &amp;amp; \frac{\partial Y}{\partial u} &amp;amp; 0 \\ \frac{\partial X}{\partial v} &amp;amp; \frac{\partial Y}{\partial v} &amp;amp; 0 \end{vmatrix} $$
Emphasize $$ \hat{x}\ \vec{x}\ \ddot{x} $$
Elastic parentheses $$ \left(\frac{x^2}{y^3}\right) $$
Scope of evaluation $$ \left. \frac{x^3}{3}\right|_0^1 $$
Diagnostic criteria $$ f(n) = \begin{cases} \frac{n}{2}, &amp;amp; \text{if } n\text{ is even} \\ 3n+1, &amp;amp; \text{if } n\text{ is odd} \end{cases} $$
Maxwell&amp;rsquo;s equations system $$ \begin{aligned} \nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{B}} -, \frac1c, \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{E}}}{\partial t} &amp;amp; = \frac{4\pi}{c}\vec{\mathbf{j}} \\ \nabla \cdot \vec{\mathbf{E}} &amp;amp; = 4 \pi \rho \\ \nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{E}}, +, \frac1c, \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{B}}}{\partial t} &amp;amp; = \vec{\mathbf{0}} \\ \nabla \cdot \vec{\mathbf{B}} &amp;amp; = 0 \end{aligned} $$
Statistics Fixed phrases:$$ \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = {^n}C_k{n \choose k}$$
Score in Score $$ \frac{\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{y}}{y-z} $$
Nth root $$ \sqrt[n]{1+x+x^2+x^3+\ldots} $$
Matrix $$ \begin{pmatrix} a_{11} &amp;amp; a_{12} &amp;amp; a_{13}\\ a_{21} &amp;amp; a_{22} &amp;amp; a_{23}\\ a_{31} &amp;amp; a_{32} &amp;amp; a_{33} \end{pmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp;amp; \cdots &amp;amp; 0 \\ \vdots &amp;amp; \ddots &amp;amp; \vdots \\ 0 &amp;amp; \cdots &amp;amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} $$
Punctuation marks $$ f(x) = \sqrt{1+x} \quad (x \ge -1) f(x) \sim x^2 \quad (x\to\infty) $$
Now use punctuation marks:
$$ f(x) = \sqrt{1+x}, \quad x \ge -1 f(x) \sim x^2, \quad x\to\infty $$

Good evening, gentlemen and ladies,
I am honored to receive the Clarke Award for Imagination in Service to Society.
This award is a reward for imagination, which is a human ability that seems to belong only to God, and its significance far exceeds our imagination. Historians have said that the reason why humans were able to establish civilization beyond other species on Earth is mainly because they were able to create things in their own brains that do not exist in reality. In the future, when artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence, imagination may be our only advantage over them.
Science fiction is a literature based on imagination, and the first one that left a deep impression on me was Arthur Clarke&amp;rsquo;s works. Except for Jules Verne and George Wells, Clarke&amp;rsquo;s works are the earliest Western modern science fiction novels to enter China. In the early 1980s, China published his works &amp;ldquo;2001: A Space Odyssey&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Rendezvous With Rama&amp;rdquo;. At that time, the Cultural Revolution had just ended, and the old life and beliefs had collapsed, while the new had not yet been established. Like other young people, I felt lost in my heart. These two books activated my imagination for the first time, and my thoughts suddenly became much broader, with the feeling of a small stream flowing into the sea. On the night I finished reading &amp;lsquo;2001: A Space Odyssey&amp;rsquo;, I walked out of my house and looked up at the starry sky. At that time, the sky in China was not too polluted, and I could see the Milky Way. In my eyes, the starry sky was completely different from the past. For the first time, I had a sense of awe towards the vastness and mystery of the universe, which was a religious feeling. And later I read &amp;lsquo;Rendezvous With Rama&amp;rsquo;, which also amazed me at how imagination can be used to construct a vivid imaginary world. It was these feelings brought to me by Clarke that later made me a science fiction writer.
Now, more than thirty years have passed, and I gradually realize that our generation born in China in the 1960s may be the luckiest people in human history, because there has never been a generation before that has witnessed such a huge change in the world around us. The world we live in now is completely different from the world we grew up in, and this change is accelerating. China is a country full of a sense of the future. China&amp;rsquo;s future may be full of challenges and crises, but it has never been as attractive as it is now. This provides fertile soil for science fiction novels, which have received unprecedented attention in China. As a science fiction writer born in China in the 1960s, it is a stroke of luck.
I look forward to one day, like those science fiction novels that once described the information age, science fiction novels that describe space travel will become mundane. At that time, Mars and the asteroid belt were boring places where countless people made a living; Jupiter and its numerous satellites have become tourist destinations, and the only obstacle preventing people from going there is the expensive price.
But even at this time, the universe remains a vast and unimaginable existence, with the nearest stars still out of reach. The vast starry sky can always carry our infinite imagination.
Thank you all.

In terms of layout, it mainly supports the site overview section in the left sidebar, as well as the two positions at the bottom of the site, but the style reset can be anywhere on the entire site.
Open configuration parameters Firstly, it is necessary to clarify that the following parameters are configured in the params area of the configuration file:
1 2 3 4 customFilePath: sidebar: custom_sidebar.html footer: custom_footer.html style: /css/custom_style.css Warning Attention: The file names of sidebar and footer cannot be the same as their parameter names, otherwise it will affect the default layout design of the system. Remember!!!: smile:
Then create two directories, &amp;rsquo;layouts/partitions&amp;rsquo;, in the root directory of the site to store custom layout design files. Additionally, create two directories,&amp;rsquo; static/css&amp;rsquo;, in the root directory of the site to store custom CSS style files. After everything is ready, you can refer to the following steps to complete your design idea.
Sidebar design Create a new file with the suffix &amp;lsquo;html&amp;rsquo; in the &amp;lsquo;partitions&amp;rsquo; directory earlier, where you can write the design or content you want to express, such as introducing some third-party component content. The example is as follows:
1 2 3 &amp;lt;div class=&amp;#34;mydefined animated&amp;#34; itemprop=&amp;#34;custom&amp;#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span&amp;gt;Support custom CSS and Sidebar layout now 💄💄💄&amp;lt;/ span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; Configure the path of the file to the corresponding parameters, please refer to the effect at the bottom of the left sidebar for the effect.
Footer design Create a new file with the suffix &amp;lsquo;html&amp;rsquo; in the &amp;lsquo;partitions&amp;rsquo; directory earlier, where you can write the design or content you want to express, such as introducing some third-party component content. The example is as follows:
1 2 3 &amp;lt;div class=&amp;#34;custom-footer&amp;#34;&amp;gt; Website source code &amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34; https://github.com/hugo-next/hugo-theme-next/tree/develop/exampleSite/layouts/partials/custom-footer.html &amp;#34; target=&amp;#34;_blank&amp;#34;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; Configure the path of the file to the corresponding parameters, please refer to the effect at the bottom of the site for the effect.
Custom Style Create a new file with the suffix &amp;lsquo;css&amp;rsquo; in the&amp;rsquo; css&amp;rsquo; directory earlier, and then redefine the style of the site or add some custom style designs to reference when writing articles. The example is as follows:
1 2 3 4 5 .custom-head5 { font-size: 1.2em; color: #ed6c24; font-weight: bold; } Configure the path of the file to the corresponding parameters, and the effect reference is as follows:

He started his own business at the age of 74, returned with Chu Cheng 10 years later, and made a comeback with billions of wealth. His development trajectory was a process of rebound.
Early stories Starting from In the spring of 2014, at the border of Huaning County and Yiliang County in Yunnan Province, a small mountain village called Yize had an old courtyard house with a history of over a hundred years demolished. The village committee is leading the villagers in the construction of a &amp;ldquo;beautiful countryside&amp;rdquo;. In one year, the old village houses will no longer be visible, replaced by new reinforced concrete residential buildings. Just like the transformation of Chinese cities 10 or 20 years ago, this small village surrounded by mountains has also begun to fall into the &amp;ldquo;construction site mode&amp;rdquo;.
Childhood waves Almost all children who grow up by the river have an undeniable talent: good at water. Chu Shijian is no exception. Not only has he developed excellent swimming skills in the Nanpan River and flower ponds since childhood, but at the age of five or six, he can already dive far with a fierce spear. Moreover, he has been able to catch fish in the ponds on the Nanpan River and riverbanks since the age of seven or eight.
Youth stories Chu Shijian&amp;rsquo;s more than ten years of living freely in the countryside were actually more than ten years of turbulent Chinese society. Especially after the Lugou Bridge Incident in 1937, the Japanese launched a full-scale invasion of China, and in just two or three years, most of China&amp;rsquo;s territory fell one after another
Ten Years of Passionate Youth Becoming a guerrilla fighter In the summer of 1948, Chu Shijian returned to his hometown and became a teacher at Lufeng Railway Station Primary School. At the same time, he continued to maintain contact with the Communist Party organization with Chu Shiren and Chu Shijie, and did some work of transmitting intelligence
War is raging Due to the significant disparity in combat effectiveness, guerrilla forces can only rely on exchanging one shot for another, specifically targeting weak areas of the enemy to attack, but more often than not, they are defending and shifting positions.
Embrace liberation In December 1949, Lu Han, the Chairman of the Nationalist Party in Yunnan Province, announced an uprising in Kunming, marking the official beginning of Yunnan&amp;rsquo;s liberation. On February 20, 1950, Chen Gong, Song Renqiong, and Zhou Baozhong led the Fourth Corps of the Second Field Army of the People&amp;rsquo;s Liberation Army into Kunming. On February 24, Chen Gong declared the liberation of the entire Yunnan province.
The discontinuity of life Falling into the bottom of life The people who were overthrown in the &amp;ldquo;anti rightist&amp;rdquo; movement had only one way to go after their &amp;ldquo;rightist&amp;rdquo; identity was determined: to be demoted to the farm. A farm is truly a place for farming, where one must live the same life as a farmer.
Conclusion Time is like a river In 2015, it was the 60th anniversary of Chu Shijian and Ma Jingfen&amp;rsquo;s marriage, known as the commemorative year of the &amp;ldquo;diamond wedding&amp;rdquo;. This is simply a reward in life. With the increasing divorce rate in China, a 60 year marriage is almost like a dream from a past life. With the companionship of a child, Chu Shijian and Ma Jingfen have experienced various storms of the country and individuals, and faced life and death together. They are not only husband and wife, but also a pair of comrades in arms. Although Ma Jingfen occasionally complains about Chu Shijian&amp;rsquo;s carelessness when he was young, in the end, she would say, &amp;ldquo;Without me, there would be no him, and without him, there would be no me
Author thanks This book started interviewing in early summer 2014 and has been completed today, taking 18 months. The &amp;lsquo;author&amp;rsquo; on the cover can only be my name, but only I know that this book contains the hearts and minds of too many people. Of course, I would like to first thank Mr. Wang Shi. Without him, there would be no book. Upon careful consideration, I realize that without Mr. Wang Shi&amp;rsquo;s constant urging and encouragement, and without my writing work today. Since I started working as a professional writer in 2006, he has created many opportunities for me to write and has generously shared his life and learning experiences and insights with me. Thank you very much for your kindness.
Finally, I would like to express my greatest gratitude to Mr. Chu Shijian. Not only because he was generous and candid in facing my various questions, but more importantly, in the process of listening to his story, his prosperous life experience, strong vitality, and his pure heart towards life and career also enriched my thinking about my own life.
